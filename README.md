# Showdown.NET

**Showdown.NET** is a **.NET library** that provides a C# interface for the [Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com) battle simulator ([repo](https://github.com/JamzOJamz/pokemon-showdown)).

## Purpose

The primary goal of **Showdown.NET** is to **expose Pokémon Showdown's battle simulator through a C# API, handling JavaScript interop behind the scenes.**

This library was originally created to add turn-based battling capabilities to [Terramon](https://github.com/JamzOJamz/Terramon), a Pokémon mod for Terraria, but it can be used in any .NET project that needs Pokémon battle mechanics.
